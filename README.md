# MOVIE SEARCH

Although this project did not incorpate the node\expess backend inital template provided I did manage to resolve the errors within the server.js.

#### This project was developed using the following libraries:
* Angular 1.0
* Firebase
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Surge.sh (used to deploy application)

#### More About These Technologies

These libraries lend themselves quite useful when building out an application.  Angular is currently the most popular MVC model and provides functionality that helps modularize and structure the code.  This project was fairly concise in it's requirements and incorporated the following:

* 1 angular app (movieApp)
* 1 angular controller (movieCtrl)

Additional Angular functionality that was leveraged was using the **$http** service to make the ajax calls and **$scope** to extend the scope of variables and functions so they can be called directly from the HTML.

Although there are several other frameworks to choose from, such as Ember and Backbone, I think Angluar has positioned itself well and has made many improvements in Angular 2.0
