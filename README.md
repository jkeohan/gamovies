#### More About These Technologies

These libraries lend themselves quite useful when building out an application.  Angular is currently the most popular MVC model and provides functionality that helps modularize and structure the code.  This project was fairly concise in it's requirements and incorporated the following:

* 1 angular app (movieApp)
* 1 angular controller (movieCtrl)

Additional Angular functionality that was leveraged was using the $http service to make the ajax calls and $scope to extend the scope of variables and functions so they can be called directly from the HTML.
